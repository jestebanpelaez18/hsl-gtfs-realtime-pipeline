# HSL GTFS Realtime Pipeline

This project is a data engineering pipeline built with **Apache Airflow** and **PySpark** to process real-time public transportation data from **HSL (Helsinki Regional Transport Authority)**.

The goal is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) GTFS Realtime data to enable insights about public transit patterns, vehicle delays, and overall system performance.
